### 👋 Hi there, I'm Andrea

- 📚 I am a PhD student at TU Delft (🇳🇱) focusing on Learning and Processing over dynamic graphs.

- 🕐 Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at Politecnico di Torino (🇮🇹), where I applied Graph Machine Learning for anomaly detection on computer networks. I was also an intern at the Huawei Munich Research Center (🇩🇪), where I studied Graph Neural Networks on heterophilous graphs.

- 🤓 I received my Master's Degree in Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence from Politecnico di Torino.
